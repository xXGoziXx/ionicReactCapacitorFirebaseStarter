We thoroughly enjoyed the Ginger Bomb, with its refreshing kick, The 1988, which had a unique, nostalgic flavor, and Thanks a Million, which left a lasting impression with its smooth, rich taste. Of course, the traditional Irish coffee was a comforting end to the meal, with its perfect blend of whiskey, coffee, and cream.\n\nThe desserts were the perfect conclusion to the dining experience. Each one was creamy and moist, offering a satisfying sweetness that lingered long after your meal. The combination of excellent food, drinks, and ambiance made our visit truly special.",

It‚Äôs a great spot to relax and indulge your eyes while taking a break. The regular latte made with dairy milk had a rich, creamy flavour that I enjoyed. However, the oat latte had an overly sour taste, which made me wonder if the oat milk hadn‚Äôt been shaken properly beforehand or if there was an issue with its freshness. Despite that, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the caf√© offers desserts you wouldn't typically find at Mud Bakery, like brownies, cakes, and pastries from Medialuna Croissanterie. It‚Äôs one of the better spots in the city for sweets and pastries.",

It would give the crust something more glazy to take out the crust surface dryness,\nAs for the carrots & pistachio mini cake, would give it a bit more pistachio for flavor and grind the carrots a bit more the chunks of carrots were very thick in style you put in salad, the kick of citrus is nice but take out the flavour of pistachio.\nThe cappuccino oat was good texture but flavour wise the oat milk brand a bit different from what I am used too  so coffee beans could blend well with different oat milk. The latte was great texture and flavour.\nRecommended  and will try in future the rest of baking goods .\nWill recommend adding more sandwiches or fast-paced food items since this location is constantly busy and will go really well with extra snacks and not just sweet grabs baking goods .",

We ordered the Turkish chili eggs and the Sasta Benny with lamb sausages, along with a special caffeine-free cuppa. I was thrilled when our amazing waiter, Amedeo, suggested I try something new‚Äîthe Ube Latte‚Äîwhich was 100% new to me and incredibly delicious!\n\nAmedeo was kind enough to chat with us in Italian after mentioning he was from Italy, which my friends loved as they enjoy hearing me switch languages. He was friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home. To top it all off, he surprised us with mini toffee donuts as a treat from the house, which was the perfect end to an already fantastic brunch.\n\nThank you to all the staff at S√°sta By The River for the warm hospitality, delicious food, and memorable experience. Life is truly better when you‚Äôre surrounded by kind people like you! Highly recommend this place and can‚Äôt wait to return!"

I waited 15mins to get my cocktail after paying. Another girl in my group was overcharged nearly ‚Ç¨10 for her drinks order, when she pointed it out they gave her back ‚Ç¨3.20 in coins?! We paid ‚Ç¨250 for food for 15 people - we got 4 small plates of sausage rolls and cheese balls. We were all starving, was told more food was coming then it didn‚Äôt (until we strongly complained then they gave us some plastic bowls of cake). Food was meant to come out at 8:30pm, it came out at 9:20pm and the manager said that was because someone in our group told him to do that - absolute lie. The staff told us not to order at the bar and they‚Äôd take our order from the table, then they seemed to get annoyed at us ordering and the service became atrocious. There was so many things that were bad it‚Äôs hard to get it in writing. Will never return üëé",

It had a lot more dry parts than I'd like though.\n\nPotato salad was AMAZING! There was so much going on in it.\n\nSlaw was decent. Taste was on the more neutral, milder side.\n\nIt was a lot of food so I'd say good value. Would definitely return."

There was decent music playing. I could see people eating and there was a really good vibe. The bar man was quick and professional while still being friendly.\nThere‚Äôs a small cocktail list written on a chalk board. Short and sweet. It‚Äôs better to be a great at a few cocktails than average at a loads of cocktails.\nThe smoking section is outdoors and it‚Äôs small but we got chairs.\nThe toilets were clean.\nOverall I‚Äôd recommend this bar and I‚Äôll definitely be back",

They also serve various starters to choose from and all look very appetising. Staff were very welcoming. The place is a bit small but very cozy and can get crowded easily. Luckily when we were there they were not many people but started to fill up quicky as dinner roll into the evening. Would highly recommend anyone who wants to enjoy a good bowl of ramen. However be prepare to pay around 15-20euros each. Would definitely come back to try the different ramen and starters",

I wish they where more ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù also felt they where a bit bland taste have been better a bit bland like the meat didn‚Äôt soak up the flavours. The broccoli for starters was perfectly cooked and garnished.\nThe lemon grass chicken was too sweet my friend couldn‚Äôt finish it.\nI really enjoyed my Mongolian fillet it was crunchy spicy vegetables perfectly cooked for 27euro u expect a bit more beef but that‚Äôs Dublin.\n\nOverall would give 5 stars but food was ok.

Anyway, roll forward a few minutes and they are serving another table and then proceed to spill a glass of coke all over our table and my friend and her dress. Again they basically sighed a sorry and then just walked away. At this point it‚Äôs just kind of funny but also really shocking. We go to pay and I have a raised eyebrow if we‚Äôll get any sort of apology. No. We asked to split the bill, they said, how much each??

The food was decent‚Äîperhaps not extraordinary, but the prices are better than many other places in Dublin, which is a definite plus. The staff were friendly overall, although they forgot a glass of wine I ordered. Instead of following up, we chose to move on to dessert.

The attention from the waitresses was excellent, always making sure our water was filled and fresh. The food is super delicious and abundant, just the way I like it. I was very satisfied with every dish, and I highly recommend starting with the calamari because it has a slightly spicy and very tasty touch. I will definitely come back to try more delicious dishes.
